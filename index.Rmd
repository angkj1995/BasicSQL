This tutorial provides a rundown on SQL commands to query relational databases. The content of this tutorial is inspired by IBM's [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) on Coursera. The tutorial assumes prior knowledge on relational database concepts

## Dataset

The data for this tutorial are from Chicago's Data Portal, consisting of the following:

1. [Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)
    * This is a cross-sectional (single-year) data containing socioeconomic indicators (**Crowding, Poverty, Unemployment, Age distribution, Income**) for each community area in Chicago
2. [Chicago Public Schools](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t)
    * This is a cross-section (single-year) data containing school performance indicators (**Health Certification, Safety Score, College Enrollment**) for each school in each comunity area in Chicago
3. [Chicago Crime Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)
    * This is a panel (multi-year) data containing crime information (**Crime type, Arrest indicator**) for each crime that occured in Chicago

### Download (csv data)

As the data from the three sources are very large, a smaller subset is used for this tutorial instead, with more database-friendly column names

1. [Census Dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/Census_Data_-_Selected_socioeconomic_indicators_in_Chicago__2008___2012-v2.csv) (read as **CENSUS_DATA**)
2. [Chicago Public School](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/Chicago_Public_Schools_-_Progress_Report_Cards__2011-2012-v3.csv) (read as **CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS**)
3. [Chicago Crime Data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/Chicago_Crime_Data-v2.csv) (**CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA**)

## Reading data

As there is no live database for this tutorial, the datasets will have to be read in as local dataframes. We will also use the **sqldf** library to practice SQL queries
```{r read, warning = FALSE,message = FALSE}
CENSUS_DATA = read.csv('Census_Data_-_Selected_socioeconomic_indicators_in_Chicago__2008___2012-v2.csv')
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS = read.csv('Chicago_Public_Schools_-_Progress_Report_Cards__2011-2012-v3.csv')
CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA = read.csv('Chicago_Crime_Data-v2.csv')
library(sqldf)
library(DT)
```

Let us take a look at some of the variables in the data that we have

### Census preview
```{r preview,echo=FALSE}
datatable(head(CENSUS_DATA),options=list(scrollX=T))
```

### School preview
```{r preview2,echo=FALSE}
datatable(head(CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS),options=list(scrollX=T))
```

### Crime preview
```{r preview3,echo=FALSE}
datatable(head(CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA),options=list(scrollX=T))
```

## Basic SQL Statements

### SELECT
SELECT is used to retrieve data from a table. The syntax is __SELECT * FROM TABLE__. This will query the entire table
```{r SELECT}
syntax = 'SELECT * FROM CENSUS_DATA'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

#### SELECT specific columns
We can also use SELECT on specific columns for a table. The syntax is **SELECT COL_A, COL_B FROM TABLE**. This will query only the specified columns for the entire table
```{r SELECTspecific}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CENSUS_DATA'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

#### LIMIT
LIMIT is used to restrict the number of rows from a data base. The syntax is __SELECT * FROM TABLE LIMIT NUMBER__, where NUMBER is the number of rows required
```{r SELECTlimit}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CENSUS_DATA LIMIT 3'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

### WHERE
WHERE clauses are used to restrict the selection to subsets only. The syntax is _SELECT * FROM TABLE_ __WHERE PREDICATE__. For instance, we want communities with *PER_CAPITA_INCOME >= 50000*
```{r WHERE}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, PER_CAPITA_INCOME FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE PER_CAPITA_INCOME>=50000'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```
More conditions are available here

|         Condition|  Syntax|
|:-----------------|----:|
|Equal to          | =   |
|Greater than      | >   |
|Less than         | <   |
|Greater than or equal to    | >=|
|Less than or equal to | <=|
|Not equal to      | <>|

### Other useful expressions

#### COUNT
COUNT gives the number of rows that match a query. For instance, we want to know how many communities have *PER_CAPITA_INCOME >= 50000*. We can also rename the column name to something we want using **AS**. This will give 6, which is the same number of rows as the previous exampls
```{r COUNT}
syntax = 'SELECT COUNT(*) AS NUMBER FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE PER_CAPITA_INCOME>=50000'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

#### DISTINCT
DISTINCT removes duplicates from the query. For instance, we want to find the unique types of crime from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA that occur at GAS STATION locations
```{r DISTINCT}
syntax = 'SELECT DISTINCT(PRIMARY_TYPE) AS CRIME_TYPE, LOCATION_DESCRIPTION FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA WHERE LOCATION_DESCRIPTION = "GAS STATION"'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```


## Advanced SQL Statements

### LIKE string pattern

String patterns are useful when we do not know the exact predicate we need. The syntax is _SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE_ __PREDICATE LIKE '%B'__  For instance, we want all Community Areas that start with B
```{r LIKE}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME LIKE "B%"'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

### AND ranges

We can also select results where the predicate is between a range. Suppose we want Community Areas where HARDSHIP_INDEX is between 1 to 10
```{r AND}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, HARDSHIP_INDEX FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX>=1 AND HARDSHIP_INDEX<=10'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

#### BETWEEN AND
Alternatively, we can use a __BETWEEN...AND__ statement for the same query
```{r BETWEEN}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, HARDSHIP_INDEX FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX BETWEEN 1 AND 10'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

### OR sets
If we want to retrieve data using a set of values, the OR operator comes in handy. It follows the same syntax as AND. If we want a community with 6 or 10 for HARDSHIP_INDEX, we can do the following:
```{r OR}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, HARDSHIP_INDEX FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX = 6 OR HARDSHIP_INDEX = 10'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

#### IN
Similarly, we can also use the IN operator, which is more efficient to type if we have many values to choose from
```{r IN}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, HARDSHIP_INDEX FROM CENSUS_DATA WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX IN (6,7,10)'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```

### ORDER BY
This clause is used for sorting results. The syntax is _SELECT * FROM TABLE_ **ORDER BY COL** where COL is the column name, or column number. To order in descending order, add **DESC** after specifying the column. For instance, if we want the top 5 communities by HARDSHIP_INDEX, we can do the following
```{r ORDER}
syntax = 'SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, HARDSHIP_INDEX FROM CENSUS_DATA ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 5'
df = sqldf(syntax)
datatable(df,options=list(scrollX=T))
```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
